# Mapping-the-Green-Product-Space-in-Mexico
The aim of this paper is to examine the current and potential capability to promote the green economy in Mexico, simultaneously detecting new opportunities for diversification and “green” productive sophistication so that Mexican entities can move toward environmentally friendly ecological products. 

We adopted a novel methodology to measure the productive capabilities of the green economy in Mexico, thereby discovering the green product space at a subnational scale. Economic complexity methods were used to estimate the Green Complexity Index (GCI) and the Green Complexity Potential (GCP) for 32 Mexican regions considering a time series from 2004 to 2018 and a set of data on international trade in ecological products. The main findings are reflected in a grid of the Green Adjacent Possible (GAP) and a heatmap that shows the “grasslands” (current green products by state). The results are likely to influence industrial policy and state innovation agendas. A limitation of this work is that it is based only on data from the formal, industrial, and regulated economy. The originality lies in the fact that there were no previous studies in the context analyzed, and the fecundity of the research reflects the need to expand the study with a focus on green business models.

Keywords: economic complexity; green economy; product space
